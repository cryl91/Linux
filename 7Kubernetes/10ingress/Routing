1. Host-based routing(Different Domains) = Decision based on the hostname (domain) in the URL. Used when you have different apps on different domains/subdomains. Example:

https://app1.example.com   → Service: app1
https://app2.example.com   → Service: app2

Ingress Yaml: 
rules:
  - host: app1.example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
            service:
              name: app1
              port:
                number: 80
  - host: app2.example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
            service:
              name: app2
              port:
                number: 80

2. Path-based routing = Decision based on the URL path after the domain. Used when you have one domain but different apps or services behind different paths. Example:

https://example.com/app1   → Service: app1
https://example.com/app2   → Service: app2

Ingress Yaml: 
rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /app1
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
            service:
              name: app1
              port:
                number: 80
        - path: /app2
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
            service:
              name: app2
              port:
                number: 80
