For running function:
1.To start console = terraform console
2. join(" ", ["siva","kumar"])
3.  max(10,20,30)
4. min(10,20,30)
5. To read file = 
        public_key = file("${path.module}/devops.pub")



--locals are similar to variable but they also allow expressions and functions
--data sources = you can query the data dynamically from source ie aws

tfvars = terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
